# Leptos-File-Explorer

This is a simple file explorer written in Rust with the Leptos framework.

# > [!WARNING]
This is not complete, for now it only lets you navigate the directories and files.
I intend to allow file and folder downloads, deletions and moves.
But I am not actively working on this, so if you want to fork and continue, go on.

# Getting things running

- Make sure you have Rust setup and `cargo-leptos` installed (This [guide](./Leptos.md) can help).

- Install and run tailwind `npx tailwindcss -i ./style/input.css -o ./style/output.css --watch`

- Run the application with `cargo leptos watch`
